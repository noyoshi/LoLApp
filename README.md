### Dependencies 
 - Code is written in python2.7
 - All data is in REQUIREMENTS.txt - 'pip install -r REQUIREMENETS.txt'
 - This uses the RiotGames API - in order to use you will need your own
   development API. Get one here: 
   https://developer.riotgames.com/


 
 Ideas:
---

 - Checks how well you are performing vs your average performance, average
   performance of pro players in same role / champ 
 - Determines what metrics you are lacking in, shows difference, suggests ways
   to improve

---
 - Seperate from the RiotGames API - Grabs screen every time the player presses
   tab (or another hotkey, to show the scoreboard), and takes the data from the
   scoreboard to give a continuously updated report to the player on how well
   they are playing, and how likely their team is to win 
 - Uses ML and a neural network to learn what metrics contribute most to a
   team's success.
